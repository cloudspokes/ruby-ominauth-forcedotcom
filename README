Description
===========
OmniAuth is a Ruby authentication system for multi-provider external authentcation. OmniAuth currently supports OAuth authentication for Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, TripIt and many more. We&#39;d like to build OAuth support for Force.com into OmniAuth as well. Create a simple web application hosted on Heroku that authorizes API access to a Force.com Developer Org and displays a list of Accounts using the REST API.

Requirements
============
The application should run on Ruby 1.9, Rails 3 &amp; Heroku. There are number of blog posts and screencasts for developing additional providers for OmniAuth at the github project site.
